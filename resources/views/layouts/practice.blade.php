			<h3>Welcome!</h3>
			<p>My name is Samuel Park, I’m an ALM IT degree candidate student at the Harvard University Extension School, and this is my website for DGMD E-27’s third assignment.</p>
			<p>Even though I have been working as an IT professional for a few years now and have basic understanding of how websites work, in depth website development, especially the front end development, is not my area of specialty, so far I am enjoying learning more about the CSS!</p>
			<p>I consider myself as an avid technology enthusiast, and have a deep interest in anything technology related across wide variety of industries including PC, mobile, audio and video. Yes you could call me “geek” and I would admit that I would fit into that category rather very well. </p>
			<p>As an avid technology enthusiast currently deeply interested in mobile technology, I currently do and have been, ever since Android vs. iOS war started, carrying 2 separate phones and use them both on a daily basis, an iPhone 6 and Sony Xperia Z3 Compact right now because I’m interested in both iOS and Android operating systems. A lot of people find this rather strange and suspect that I live a double life (how cool would that be!) but unfortunately I’m just a geek that is interested in both iOS and Android operating systems who wants to stay current on both technologies with hands on experience!</p>
			<p>This takes a little explaining to do when I get to meet new people but interestingly I find myself being asked about my opinions on new technology and advice for their next purchases from my friends and family who knows about this little secret of mine. </p>
			<p>I have been very disappointed with the quality of the so called “reviews” of many gadget review sites of these days, a lot of them are good, maybe I just don’t agree with some of them, but quite a bit of them seem to be rather biased and uneducated. </p>
			<p>When I found out that I’m supposed to come up with my own content for this assignment, I thought that this would be a perfect opportunity to at least get started on my very own gadget review site, so that’s what I have started working on. This site is by no means comprehensive, I just wanted to get my opinions out there and if just one person would find any of this content useful, that would make me very happy! </p>
			<p>Having been using a “real” smartphone since Microsoft’s Windows Mobile 5, a.k.a. the Pocket PC era and studying for my Masters in IT here at the Harvard Extension School, I would like to think that I know what I am talking about when it comes to the topic of mobile technology.</p>
			<p>Hope you find this site useful, please feel free to check out <a href="#">my reviews</a> and also <a href="#">contact me</a> if you have any questions or comments! </p>
